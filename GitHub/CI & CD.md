# Github CI/CD

## What is CI/CD

CI and CD stand for continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment. In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably. Automated build-and-test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable. The code is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as a part of the CD process. In the software world, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that enables incremental code changes from developers’ desktops to be delivered quickly and reliably to production.

## What are the Benefits of CI/CD?

Automated testing enables continuous delivery that ensures software quality and safety and increases code profitability in production. 
CI/ CD pipelines enable a much shorter time-to-market for new product features, resulting in happier customers and reducing the burden on development.
The significant increase in overall delivery speed enabled by CI/CD pipelines improves a company’s competitive advantage.
