# Terraform Use-Cases

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code. You can describe your entire infrastructure - including servers, networks, databases, and more - in declarative configuration files.

## Multi-Cloud Provisioning
Terraform supports multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others. This enables you to provision and manage infrastructure across different cloud environments using a single tool.

## Infrastructure Automation
With Terraform, you can automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of your infrastructure. This reduces manual intervention, ensures consistency, and improves efficiency.

## Collaboration and Versioning
Terraform configuration files can be stored in version control systems like Git, enabling collaboration among team members. You can track changes, manage versions, and apply infrastructure updates using standard version control practices.

## Immutable Infrastructure
Terraform promotes the concept of immutable infrastructure, where infrastructure components are treated as disposable and replaced rather than updated. This approach enhances reliability, scalability, and security.

# Terraform Life Cycle

##Initialize

The first step in using Terraform is to initialize your configuration. This is done by running:
```
terraform init
```
This command downloads the necessary providers and modules specified in your configuration files.

## Plan

After initialization, you can create an execution plan using:

```
terraform plan
```
This command generates an execution plan that shows what Terraform will do when you apply your configuration. It helps you review changes before applying them.
