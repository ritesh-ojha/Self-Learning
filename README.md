# Self Learning Timeline

Welcome to my self-learning journey! In this repository, I've documented my progress and the skills I've acquired over time. Each entry reflects my dedication to continuous learning and personal growth. Feel free to explore the commits to see the evolution of my knowledge and expertise.

## How to Navigate

- **Directories**: I've organized my learning into directories for easy access and reference.
- **Commits**: Each commit represents a milestone in my learning journey. You can track my progress and see the details of what I've learned.

## Why Documenting?

Documenting my learning process serves multiple purposes:

1. **Accountability**: By publicly documenting my progress, I hold myself accountable for continuous improvement.
2. **Reflection**: Reviewing past commits allows me to reflect on how far I've come and identify areas for further development.
3. **Sharing Knowledge**: Others can benefit from my experiences and resources I've gathered along the way.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have regarding my learning journey. Feel free to reach out with insights, recommendations, or questions.

Thank you for joining me on this self-learning adventure!
