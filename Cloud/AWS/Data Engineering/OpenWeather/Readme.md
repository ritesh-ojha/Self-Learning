# OpenWeather Data Engineering Project README

## Overview

This project is a data engineering pipeline implemented using Apache Airflow on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for processing OpenWeather data. The pipeline involves extracting weather data from the OpenWeather API, transforming it, and loading it into a data warehouse for analysis and visualization.

## Components

### 1. Data Source

- **OpenWeather API**: Data is extracted from the OpenWeather API, which provides current weather data, forecasts, and historical weather data.

### 2. AWS Services

- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Used for storing intermediate data files and any necessary configuration files.


- **Apache Airflow**: Used for orchestrating the data pipeline.
  - **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: Define the workflow of the pipeline.
  - **Operators**: Perform tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading.
  - **Schedulers**: Schedule and monitor the execution of tasks.
